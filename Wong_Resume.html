        I went on this field trip to Stanford University and the Computer
        Science History Museum with some of the students from the Dublin High
        School Engineering Academy. The reason I chose to go to this field trip was to
        learn more about Stanford, and consider it as a college to apply to
        after high school as a future computer science major. The museum was a
        nice addition to the field trip because I was able to learn about the
        history and progress over time in technology, specifically computer
        science. This experience was both useful and memorable because it helped
        me learn more about the computer science world's past, as well as
        the history and traditions of Stanford. Overall, this trip helped me
        to attain a better understanding and wider view of computer science,
        and to explore another college option to widen my plans after high
        school.

      Course: POE (Principles of Engineering)

    <p>
      Topic: Chernobyl, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence

      One of the guest speakers I had the honor of listening to while in
      POE (Principles of Engineering) was Maynard Holliday. He was at one time
      the senior technical advisor to the United States of America's
      undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics.
      He worked on the remediation for the Chernobyl nuclear accident, using
      both his skills in robotics and artificial intelligence. Holliday was
      particularly interesting to me, since my career interest is in computer
      science, specifically in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
      One key takeaway that I got from this presentation was that machine
      learning utilizes of the following: speech recognition, digital
      assistance, fingerprint identification, computational photography, facial
      recognition, and producing text. In summary, this presentation was
      helpful to me because it was beneficial to see a professional in the
      industry, and see his projects and his thinking process through them.

        Guest Speaker: Laura Kegelmeyer

    </p>
    <p>
      Course: POE (Principles of Engineering)
    </p>
    <p>
      Topic: NIF (National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory) & Machine Learning

      Another guest speaker in POE (Principles of Engineering) that presented
      in class was Laura Kegelmeyer who worked at the NIF (National Ignition
      Facility) at Lawrence Livermore Nation Laboratory. Her main topic was
      machine learning, similar to Maynard Holliday, but used in a different
      situation. A key takeaway from her presentation was what NIF does.
      It studies fusion and ignition, and therefore helps to explore the
      cosmos, and enables clean energy security for humankind. This
      presentation inspired me because it showed that there are useful
      applications for engineering this concept could help humanity,
      which has driven me to continue studying engineering in general and
      especially machine learning. Overall, Kegelmeyer's presentation helped
      me see the amount of good that engineers can do for the world, making
      technology and equipment work together with people to better the lives
      of many.

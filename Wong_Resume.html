        I went on this field trip to Stanford University and the Computer
        Science History Museum with some of the students from the Dublin Engineering
        and Design Academy. The reason I chose to go to this field trip was to
        learn more about Stanford, and consider it as a college to apply to
        after high school as a future computer science major. The museum was a
        nice addition to the field trip because I was able to learn about the
        history and progress over time in technology, specifically computer
        science. This experience was both useful and memorable because it helped
        me learn more about the computer science world's past, as well as
        the history and traditions of Stanford. Overall, this trip helped me
        to attain a better understanding and wider view of computer science,
        and to explore another college option to widen my plans after high
        school.

        I went on this field trip to the California State University Maritime Academy and SunPower
        with some of the students from the Dublin Engineering and Design
        Academy. I chose to go on this field trip to learn more about different systems of colleges,
        including the California State University system, separate from the
        University of California system. I learned a lot about life as a student
        attending this college that focuses on teaching students specifically about ships.
        CSU Maritime offers its students an opportunity to spend a semester aboard
        its training ship, the Golden Bear, travelling internationally. My favourite
        part of this field trip was touring the training ship. Overall, this trip helped me
        to attain a better understanding and wider view of the entire field of engineering
        and to explore another college option to widen my options after high
        school. At Sun Power, I was able to learn more about how solar power works and how solar panels are built.
        We were also given the opportunity to group interview some engineers at the company about their
        jobs and responsibilities.

        I went on this field trip to Simpson Strong-Tie with the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy. During this
        field trip, we had the opportunity to take a tour of their facility and learn how the company does procedures
        such as stress tests on their products. I learned a lot about what goes into making a connector from beginning
        to end. The most interesting part about this field trip was learning about the variation in the products that are
        specifically made for different regions. For example, the parts that are built for buildings in California are
        made to be more resistant to earthquakes. This effect is produced by designing the connectors between tall
        building levels to allow the building to sway from side to side during an earthquake rather than just crack
        immediately. I was fascinated to learn how small changes like this could protect a building against a large
        natural disaster like an earthquake.

        I went on this field trip to Six Flags with a school club called GETSET, which stands for "Girls Exploring
        Technology, Science, and Engineering Together". This club provides amazing opportunities for women to
        explore the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields and see where their interests lie.
        The core idea behind the foundation of this club is to try to raise the historically low number of women working
        in STEM fields. During this field trip, we had a behind-the-scenes look at some of the exotic animals housed
        at the zoo. Specifically, we visited the giraffes, sharks, and dolphins, and learned about how the staff
        takes care of these species, including feeding, cleaning, and vet visits. This experience was interesting because
        I aspire to become a veterinarian and this trip provided a deeper look into the career specifically pertaining to
        exotic animals. It helped me get a deeper insight into what it truly means to be a veterinarian, and the
        daily responsibilities and life of one.

        This amazing field trip with the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy was a large networking event that
        empowered women in STEM, and encouraged female students to pursue a career in STEM. I was able to meet many women
        in many different careers, and it was inspiring to see so many successful and happy women who were able to overcome
        the traditional gender gap in STEM fields. We attended several workshops discussing different career paths,
        but my favorite part of the event was the opportunity to have lunch while networking with industry professionals.
        During lunch, I met many interesting women who were happy to answer my questions about their career paths and

        Wastewater Treatment Plant given over Zoom. We were able to view all of the different buildings inside of the
        plant and their functions. It was interesting to learn about the processing that wastewater must go though before
        it can be recycled (either to be used as recycled water for watering lawns or released into the ocean),
        but the most interesting fact I learned was that if the water in our plant went through
        one more cleaning process, it could be clean enough to be used as drinking water.

        For this field trip, I had the opportunity to attend a virtual career day presentation given by Roche. This
        presentation was especially relevant because the panel of scientists discussed their response to the Covid-19
        pandemic, which included the development of a rapid SarsCov2 diagnostic test. On the second day of the presentation,
        we were able to learn more about the jobs of each of the scientists and what their education level was in order
        to obtain that job. We also participated in a simulation of the launching of a product with the panel of
        scientists, which included the brainstorming of ideas and researching of how the ideas would be implemented.

      One of the guest speakers I had the honor of listening to while taking the class
      POE (Principles of Engineering) was Maynard Holliday. He was previously
      the senior technical advisor to the United States of America's
      undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics.
      He worked on the remediation for the Chernobyl nuclear accident, using
      both his skills in robotics and artificial intelligence. I found Holliday's presentation extremely
      interesting since I am very interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
      One key takeaway that I got from this presentation was that machine
      learning utilizes all of the following: speech recognition, digital
      assistance, fingerprint identification, computational photography, facial
      recognition, and producing text. In summary, this presentation was
      helpful to me because it was beneficial to see an industry professional's projects and his process of completing
      them.

      Another guest speaker in POE (Principles of Engineering) that presented
      in class was Laura Kegelmeyer who worked at the NIF (National Ignition
      Facility) at Lawrence Livermore Nation Laboratory. Her main topic was
      machine learning, similar to Maynard Holliday, but used in a different
      situation. A key takeaway from her presentation was what NIF does.
      It studies fusion and ignition, and therefore helps to explore the
      cosmos, and enables clean energy security for humankind. This
      presentation inspired me because it showed that there are useful
      applications for engineering this concept could help humanity,

      and the different projects that he has worked on that implemented neural networks or artificial intelligence.
      A key takeaway from his presentation was the way neural networks work, and how computer scientists like him
      work to refine them so that they make less mistakes. In my opinion, his most interesting project to date is a project where
      he used neural networks to identify images. He would input an image and the network would tell him what it
      thought the image was, and how certain it was that it was that answer. The network identified images by looking
      for patterns. For example, there was one pattern of pure black, and one of pure white. Then, it looked for edges.
      For example, black on the left of a straight edge, and white on the right, or other such patterns. Through a trial
      and error system with many images, the neural network eventually got to the best it would be. The engineers found
      out that this was the end of refinements they could make to the system because some outliers would throw the
      system off, but the majority of the images would be recognized correctly.

    In my junior year of high school, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in the Mentorship Program run by the Dublin Engineering
    and Design Academy. It pairs students with mentors in STEM industries to introduce students to options after
    high school, including trade school, community college, or a traditional four-year university. It also prepares
    students for college and a career after college if this is the route they want to take. I met weekly with other students
    in the academy, developing my skills in networking, interview etiquette, and more. Then, once a month, I met with my
    mentor to put these skills to the test. My mentor was Connie Nguyen, a software development engineer at Workday.
    She was very supportive and helped me learn more about college and careers from the perspective of someone
    who went to a four-year university and is now working in the computer science industry.

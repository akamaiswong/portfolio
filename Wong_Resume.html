        I went on this field trip to Stanford University and the Computer
        Science History Museum with some of the students from the Dublin Engineering
        and Design Academy. The reason I chose to go to this field trip was to
        learn more about Stanford, and consider it as a college to apply to
        after high school as a future computer science major. The museum was a
        nice addition to the field trip because I was able to learn about the
        history and progress over time in technology, specifically computer
        science. This experience was both useful and memorable because it helped
        me learn more about the computer science world's past, as well as
        the history and traditions of Stanford. Overall, this trip helped me
        to attain a better understanding and wider view of computer science,
        and to explore another college option to widen my plans after high
        school.

        I went on this field trip to the California State University Maritime Academy
        with some of the students from the Dublin Engineering and Design
        Academy. I chose to go on this field trip to learn more about different systems of colleges,
        including the California State University system, separate from the
        University of California system. I learned a lot about life as a student
        attending this college, as it focuses on teaching students about ships.
        CSU Maritime offers its students opportunities to spend a semester aboard
        its training ship, the Golden Bear, travelling internationally. My favourite
        part of this field trip was touring the training ship. Overall, this trip helped me
        to attain a better understanding and wider view of the entire field of engineering,
        and to explore another college option to widen my options after high
        school.

          Field Trip: Six Flags Discovery Museum (Vallejo, California)

        I went on this field trip to Six Flags with a school club called GETSET. Its name stands for Girls Exploring
        Technology, Science, and Engineering Together. This club provides amazing opportunities for women to
        explore the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields and see where their interests lie.
        The core idea behind the foundation of this club is to try to raise the historically low number of women working
        in STEM fields. During this field trip, we had a behind-the-scenes look at some of the exotic animals housed
        at the zoo. Specifically, we visited the giraffes, sharks, and dolphins, and learned about how the staff
        takes care of them, including feeding, cleaning, and vet visits. This experience was interesting because
        I am also looking into veterinary medicine as a career option, and this trip was very informative and
        provided a deeper look into the career. In summary, this trip helped me learn more about the field of
        veterinary medicine (specifically pertaining to exotic animals), and helped me to see the
        realities of the field, and decide if I could see myself working as a veterinarian.

      One of the guest speakers I had the honor of listening to while in the class
      POE (Principles of Engineering) was Maynard Holliday. He was at one time
      the senior technical advisor to the United States of America's
      undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics.
      He worked on the remediation for the Chernobyl nuclear accident, using
      both his skills in robotics and artificial intelligence. Holliday was
      particularly interesting to me, since my career interest is in computer
      science, specifically in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
      One key takeaway that I got from this presentation was that machine
      learning utilizes of the following: speech recognition, digital
      assistance, fingerprint identification, computational photography, facial
      recognition, and producing text. In summary, this presentation was
      helpful to me because it was beneficial to see a professional in the
      industry, and see his projects and his thinking process through them.

      Another guest speaker in POE (Principles of Engineering) that presented
      in class was Laura Kegelmeyer who worked at the NIF (National Ignition
      Facility) at Lawrence Livermore Nation Laboratory. Her main topic was
      machine learning, similar to Maynard Holliday, but used in a different
      situation. A key takeaway from her presentation was what NIF does.
      It studies fusion and ignition, and therefore helps to explore the
      cosmos, and enables clean energy security for humankind. This
      presentation inspired me because it showed that there are useful
      applications for engineering this concept could help humanity,
      which has driven me to continue studying engineering in general and
      especially machine learning. Overall, Kegelmeyer's presentation helped
      me see the amount of good that engineers can do for the world, making
      technology and equipment work together with people to better the lives
      of many.

      Dr. Maher Salloum was a guest speaker from Sandia National Laboratories, who was particularly interesting to me,
      because of his work in the medical field. Although his Ph.D. was in mechanical engineering, he was able to
      help develop a new method for treating cancer. His Ph.D. research was focused on treating cancer with
      magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia, based on the multiscale transport phenomena in biological tissues.
      This was inspiring to me because it showed the wide range of fields that engineering has an impact on, and how
      engineering can better lives in many ways.

      A guest speaker that we had the honor of meeting while in AP CSA was Jason Yosinski. He obtained his PhD from
      Cornell University, and is a founding member of Uber AI Labs. He talked about his work with neural networks,
      and the different projects that he has worked on that implemented neural networks or artificial intelligence.
      A key takeaway from his presentation was the way neural networks work, and how computer scientists like him
      work to refine them so that they make less mistakes. To me, his most interesting project was a project where
      he used neural networks to identify images. He would input an image, and the network would tell him what it
      thought the image was of, and how certain it was that it was that answer. The network identified images by looking
      for patterns. For example, there was one pattern of pure black, and one of pure white. Then, it looked for edges.
      For example, black on the left of a straight edge, and white on the right, or other such patterns. Through a trial
      and error system with many images, the neural network eventually got to the best it would be. The engineers found
      out that this was the end of refinements they could make to the system because some outliers would throw the
      system off, but the majority of the images would be recognized correctly.

            I found this guest speaker particularly fascinating because I am exploring careers in the veterinary field right now,
            and currently aspire to be a veterinarian, since I have always had a love for both STEM and animals.
            She went to veterinary school and specialized in veterinary pathology, and currently works at Amgen to
            develop veterinary medicines. She presented some cases that she had worked on, and how her team worked
            through different problems, including the most effective way to administer different experimental drugs,
            how to lower the risk of infection with long term catheters, and others. I also had the opportunity to
            follow up with her after the presentation, and she was generous enough to give me detailed answers to all of
            my questions, including her favourite and least favourite parts of her job.

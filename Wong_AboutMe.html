    <p class="container">
      I am currently a high school senior attending Dublin High School in Dublin, California. This year, I am taking
      multiple AP classes in preparation to attend college next year. These classes include AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Chinese,
      AP English Literature/Composition, and AP Microeconomics. In the past, I have taken AP Chemistry, AP European History,
      AP Statistics, and AP Computer Science Applications.
    </p>

    <p class="container">
        At Dublin High School, I am also a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High School,
        after being one of just 60 students accepted from over 130 applicants in the spring of 2017.
        This is a competitive program that assists students in furthering their knowledge of different STEM fields,
        including computer science and electrical engineering. This program has provided me access to specialized
        STEM classes designed for high-achieving students and a mentorship program in which I was paired with a mentor in
        a STEM field. These opportunities allowed me to practice networking, interviewing, and more career skills. To see more about
        my mentorship experience, click on the work experience tab.

    <p class="container">
      I aspire to become a veterinarian in the future. I foster dogs from local animal rescues, and prior to the pandemic,
        volunteered weekly at another. I am currently working as a veterinary technician assistant at Four Paws
        Veterinary Center where I assist in routine veterinarian examinations, inject subcutaneous vaccinations,
        and provide common services to clients' pets such as nail trims and ear washes.
    </p>


    <p class="container">
      My other interests include music and community service. I have played the violin for a total of five years in the
        Fallon Middle School and Dublin High School orchestras. Independently, I have also played the piano for eight
        years, achieving the most advanced level Certificate of Merit in piano awarded by the Music Teachers'
        Association of California. In addition to my volunteer work at animal shelters,
        I have been a Girl Scout since elementary school, and am currently a Girl Scout Ambassador, having completed
        many community service projects during my years in this organization.

      I am currently a high school senior attending Dublin High School in Dublin, California. This year, I am taking
      multiple AP classes in preparation to attend college next year. These classes include AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Chinese,
      AP English Literature/Composition, and AP Government. In the past, I have taken AP Chemistry, AP European History,
      AP Statistics, and AP Computer Science Applications.

    <p class="container col-sm-6">
      My career goal is to become a veterinarian. I volunteer weekly at the local animal shelter, Valley Humane
      Society, in addition to fostering dogs from two other animal rescues, the East Bay SPCA and
      Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation (ARF).
      I have also shadowed at a veterinary clinic previously and assisted in lab work, routine examinations and
      vaccinations of patients. Currently, I am looking for other opportunities to work as an assistant or intern
      at another veterinary practice.
      However, this is not to say that I have not explored other careers.
      I am a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High School, after being one
      of just 60 students accepted from over 130 applicants in the spring of 2017.  This is a competitive program that
      assists students in furthering their knowledge of the different disciplines of engineering,
      including computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical
      engineering. In addition to taking advantage of its access to specialized STEM classes designed for
      high-achieving students, I have also graduated from its mentorship program in which I was paired with a mentor in
      a STEM field, and was provided with opportunities to network, practice interviewing, and more. To see more about
      my mentorship experience, look under the work experience tab.

      Even though I wish to pursue a career in STEM, I keep a well-balanced life by pursuing my love of music.
      I have played the violin for total of five years in the Fallon Middle School and Dublin High School orchestras,
      dedicating time to practice and perform in concerts. Independently, I have played the piano for eleven years,
      achieving multiple piano Certificates of Merit, including the most advanced level Certificate issued by the
      Music Teachers' Association of California. This qualification means that I am certified to teach piano to others.

      Finally, my lifelong goal has been to make a positive impact on my community. Besides volunteering at
      animal shelters as mentioned previously, I am an active member of several school community service clubs,
      including Interact and California Scholarship Federation. I have also been a Girl Scout for eight years, and am
      currently a Girl Scout Ambassador.
      For my Girl Scout Silver Award, I partnered with the East Bay to build sustainable dog toys that can be
      used for years. In addition, I made baskets containing items for new cat owners including cat scratching boards,
      which provided an incentive for members of the community to adopt older cats that had been in the shelter for a
      longer period of time and were in need of a home. Currently, I am working on my Girl Scout Gold Award,
      the highest award available to Girl Scouts. I will be building community garden beds in partnership with Eden
      Gardens, which will serve people who cannot afford to have a steady supply of healthy produce by providing them
      a place and tools to grow their own fruits and vegetables. My hope for this project is to help less fortunate
      members of the community live healthier lives, since many pick the least expensive food options,
      instead of the healthier and more costly vegetables due to lack of funds. My Girl Scout projects can be viewed on
      my project page, along with some images of my musical performances, foster dogs, and school projects. If
      you would like to contact me, you can reach me at akamaiwong@gmail.com.

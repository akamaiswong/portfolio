        My career goal is to become a computer engineer. My parents are both 
        computer engineers that work for Workday, and I have always looked up 
        to them. This field interests me because it has many opportunities for 
        young adults and is blooming with possibilities in this age. I have also
        always wanted to do something that affected many people in a positive 
        way, and the best way to do that internationally is with the Internet.
        To achieve my goals, I plan to finish my high school years and go to 
        college afterwards. In my summers, I plan to do internships at 
        various companies (preferably companies that work in the computer 
        software fields).

        My strengths and personal qualities are shown from several different 
        achievements. Diligence and persistence are shown from my high level in 
        my piano testing. Patience, resourcefulness, and ability to be a 
        team player are shown from my Girl Scout Silver Award. My achievement 
        of Honour Roll in all semesters of middle school showed intelligence and
        responsibility. Taking my orchestra class taught me that stepping 
        aside and letting someone else take the spotlight can be just as 
        rewarding as being the center of attention. The class 'Computer Science
        and Engineering' I took last year taught me that it's okay to get a B 
        instead of an A, as long as I learned something. The engineering class 
        that I am currently taking, 'Principles of Engineering' is teaching me 
        that problems can have multiple different soluions, there is no singular 
        correct answer. Therefore, the engineering world will keep growing and 
        evolving from new people improving previous solutions, and making their
        own solutions.

          I hope that the process of making this website will help further my 
          knowledge of computer science and engineering principles.

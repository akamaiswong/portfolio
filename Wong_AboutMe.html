        My career goal is to become a computer engineer, and I am currently in 
        the Engineering Academy at my school, Dublin High School, after being 
        accepted last year. This is an exclusive program that assists students 
        in furthering their knowledge of the different disciplines of engineering,
        including computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical 
        engineering. It provides the students in the Academy access to several 
        specialized classes, as well as mentors who are currently in the industry,
        but is only functional during the school year. Therefore, during the 
        summer, I usually take additional classes to get ahead in the 
        requirements to graduate, do individual projects, or participate in 
        summer programs or internships at colleges.

        Something unique about myself is that although I wish to pursue a STEM 
        career, I keep a well-balanced life by making time for literature and 
        the arts as well. I love to read fiction books, any type, ranging from
        fantasy to historical fiction. I have played the violin for four years, 
        so at school, I play in the Dublin High School Orchestra, dedicating 
        time to practice and perform in concerts. After school, I take private 
        lessons once a week for the piano. Over the course of eight years, I 
        have achieved multiple Certificates of Merit, issued by the Music 
        Teachers Association of California. Currently, I am at level 10, the
        highest level, meaning that I am certified to teach piano to others. I
        am also a Girl Scout, and have achieved the Girl Scout Silver Award.
        This award requires at least 50 hours of work, and needs to have a 
        lasting or sustainable impact on the world. I am currently working on
        my Gold Award, the most prestigious and highest ranking award in Girl
        Scouts.

      My career goal is to become a veterinarian. I volunteer at a local animal shelter (Valley Humane
      Society) weekly, in addition to fostering dogs from another shelter (East Bay SPCA).
      I have also shadowed at a veterinary clinic previously, and assisted in lab work and routine examinations and
      vaccinations of patients. However, this is not to say that I have not explored other careers.
      I am currently a member of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High School, after being one
      of just 60 students accepted from over 130 applicants in the spring of 2017.  This is a competitive program that
      assists students in furthering their knowledge of the different disciplines of engineering,
      including computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical
      engineering. In addition to providing students in the Academy access to specialized STEM classes designed for
      high-achieving students, it also has a mentorship program that pairs students with mentors in STEM industries to
      prepares students for college and careers, providing opportunities for networking, interview practice, and more.

      Something unique about myself is that although I wish to pursue a STEM
      career, I keep a well-balanced life by pursuing my love of music. I have played the violin for total of five years
      in the Fallon Middle School and Dublin High School orchestras, dedicating time to practice and perform in concerts.
      Independently, I have played the piano for ten years, achieving multiple Certificates of Merit in piano. I
      achieved the most advanced level Certificate issued by the Music Teachers' Association of California, meaning
      that I am certified to teach piano to others.

      Finally, my lifelong goal has been to make a positive impact on my local community. Besides volunteering at
      animal shelters as mentioned previously, I am an active member of several school community service clubs,
      including Interact and California Scholarship Federation. I have also been a Girl Scout for eight years.
      For my Girl Scout Silver Award, I partnered with the East Bay SPCA, and built sustainable dog toys that could be
      used for years. In addition, I made baskets containing items for new cat owners including cat scratching boards,
      which provided an incentive for members of the community to adopt older cats that had been in the shelter for a
      longer period of time and had less chance of getting adopted. Currently, I am working on my Girl Scout Gold Award,
      the highest award available to Girl Scouts. I will be building community garden beds in partnership with Eden
      Gardens, which will serve people who cannot afford to have a steady supply of healthy produce by providing them
      a place and tools to grow their own fruits and vegetables. My hope for this project is to help less fortunate
      members of the community live healthier lives, since many pick the least expensive food options,
      instead of the healthier and more costly vegetables due to lack of funds. My Girl Scout projects can be seen on
      my project page, along with some images of my musical performances, foster dogs, and school projects. If
      you would like to contact me, you can reach me at

      My career goal is to become a computer engineer, specifically in the
      field of website design. I am currently in
      the Engineering Academy at my school, Dublin High School, after being
      accepted in 2017. This is an exclusive program that assists students
      in furthering their knowledge of the different disciplines of engineering,
      including computer science, mechanical engineering, and electrical
      engineering. It provides the students in the Academy access to several
      specialized classes, as well as mentors who are currently in the industry,
      but is only functional during the school year. Therefore, during the
      summer, I usually take additional classes to take more AP classes during the semester,
      or do individual projects.

      Something unique about myself is that although I wish to pursue a STEM
      career, I keep a well-balanced life by making time for literature and
      the arts as well. I love to read any type of fiction novel, ranging from
      fantasy to historical fiction. I have played the violin for five years,
      and at school, I played in the Dublin High School Orchestra for two years, dedicating
      time to practice and perform in concerts. Separate from school, I play the piano on my own.
      Over the course of eight years, I
      have achieved multiple Certificates of Merit, issued by the Music
      Teachers Association of California. Currently, I am at level 10, the
      highest level, meaning that I am certified to teach piano to others. I
      am also a Girl Scout, and have achieved the Girl Scout Silver Award.
      This award requires at least 50 hours of work, and needs to have a
      lasting or sustainable impact on the world. I am currently working on completing
      my Gold Award, the most prestigious and highest ranking award in Girl
      Scouts.

      I hope that the process of making this website will help further my
      knowledge of computer science and engineering principles.
      Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and feel free
      to enjoy the rest of this website at your own leisure. If
      you would like to contact me, you can reach me at

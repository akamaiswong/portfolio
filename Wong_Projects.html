        For this project, I worked with a partner named Justin Tsai. 
        We were tasked with coding either a game or story using Scratch,
        that implemented user interface and was relatively user-friendly with 
        as little glitches as possible. We were given two introductions to 
        Scratch, a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJtOwEhURldFN17FHMg9Xu0fixcJYUb_oqkAQPK6u_E/edit" target="blank">basic</a> one, and a more <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Oig2WzcyH4TxpAdfTKmupk-PjA6mItcHrYqY-F3ov0/edit" target="blank"> advanced </a> 
        one, then were allowed to make our own project. We decided to make a 
        game where the main character was trying to break out of detention, 
        and the player had to pick between two different places that the 
        person could go, to help the person find his way out. The character 
        told the player how to make him choose between different places, and 
        at some places, the character ran into different people. This meant 
        that we not only had to program the main sprite, but the other secondary
        ones as well. The game originally included making the player use arrow 
        keys to control the sprite, but we changed the controls to use different 
        lettered keys instead to make the game easier to play. We also made a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owITbXnfQCBjaILHuhQHm4CT7g0wR_EuvXK-EWCfS5o/edit" target="blank">project log</a>
        to daily record the work that we did. In this project, Justin was 
        mostly responsible for the flowchart and visuals of the project - 
        he selected backgrounds, and images for the main sprites, while I was 
        responsible for most of the coding He was the main visionary for this 
        project, while I was the main programmer. I also completed the vast 
        majority of the project log, (as linked above). Through this project, 
        we gained a better understanding of the workings of Scratch, 
        and I also learned how to work with a partner effectively.

          Objective: The objective was to create a brand image for a fictional 
          or real company. It needed to represent their product in a memorable 
          fashion. The purpose was to increase sales.

        For this project, I worked with a partner named Soumya Kakarlapudi. The 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/199e9Tv8Ngk34M6SRc6Vk8ADr920vl0-XYr7l_XFbVbE/edit" target="blank">instructions</a> 
        were to make a logo for a fiction or creative company, as explained in 
        more detail in the objective above. The customer that we chose was
        Amazon, and we chose to work with their recent product, the Echo Dot, 
        also known as Alexa. We compiled an amount of logos from the apps that
        Alexa can connect to, and resized and cropped them all to the same size. 
        Afterwards, we pasted them, along with the actual Alexa logo onto an
        image of Alexa. We used a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekKP4CvQ5SjH4lznVZ2eB3gfGpilIMBYL9YA-lZKp6s/edit" target="blank">project log</a> 
        to document our progress in the project daily. A challenge we faced 
        was in making the loops for the manipulation less file specific.
        We had to change our code from being file specific, to functions with
        loops to encompass all of the images. This was the part of the project 
        that I focused on. Soumya focused mostly on coding the images, 
        uploading them into the workspace and cropping them, while I did most 
        of the coding for the loops and pasting. I also worked on the 
        semi-transparency of the images. The images that we modified can be 
        found in the project log (linked above) in original and modified forms 
        - along with credits for the original images. This project was helpful 
        in learning image manipulation in Python, and was also a great lesson in 
        teamwork, leadership, and delegating different tasks to different 
        people based on their strengths and weaknesses.

          Objective: The objective of this project was to find a configuration 
          of solar or hydrogen cells in either a series or a parallel 
          configuration to recommend to Tesla Motors. We would 
          build a prototype vehicle to test out the configuration and show it

        For this project, I worked with partners Niharika Suravarjjala and 
        Amelyn Phang. The 
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxpJ4oJGPvMTvf8QJ40VBZ83M38KrFdOivnJD6URbgk/edit" target = "blank">instructions</a>
        were to create a prototype of a vehicle that could be fueled by solar
        or hydrogen cells in different configurations, as explained in further 
        detail in the objective above. The customer was Tesla Motors, as the 
        project was inspired by Tesla Motor's recent environment friendly cars 
        with renewable energy sources. We built the car with VEX parts, and a 
        breadboard for wiring the energy sources. Throughout this project, we 
        divided the project into several major parts, and each took main 
        responsibility for one, but still helped with the others. For my 
        part, I focused on documentation and wiring the breadboard with the 
        different cell configurations. For the actual building of the car, I 
        attached the standoffs and top layer of the car, to make our signature 
        double-decker car look. Then, I contributed to the planning of the 
        attachment of the cells to the top layer of the car. We used 
        configurations of a single solar cell, two solar cells in parallel, 
        a singular hydrogen cell, and two hydrogen cells in series. As 
        discussed in our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAjFSbsq86-68C7-uKDeBszRYJpdwPyK2dyZ5QxaWIk/edit" target = "blank">project log,</a> 
        we eventually found that the car was the most efficient with a singular 
        solar cell wired to the motor. We thought this was because the car
        was built with a simple design meant to be as light as possible,
        and easy to put together for the manufacturers. This configuration
        was the most efficient, with an efficiency of 53%. Additionally,
        this design was the most practical. The single solar cell is easier
        to implement, as a singular solar cell is cheaper than any of the other 
        options and is the easiest to install in a real life car.

        For this project, I worked with partners Shriya Reddy and Jasleen Kaur.
        The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sbyTgEY2PS-yhxM73Hd9YOP_NZ5TxKOUIj4rc77ZEsE/edit" target="blank">instructions</a>
        were to design and make two rocket projectiles each, to launch off of 
        a launcher, as explained in further detail in the objective above. 
        The customer was Nitro Planes, who wanted toy projectiles to sell 
        alongside their new rocket launcher. We built these model projectiles 
        out of paper products (printer paper, construction paper, etc.), and 
        tape products (duct tape, masking tape, packing tape, etc.). This project  
        was graded according to this
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHFa0UHkssiVrTGkuPOjCBKuntp3Vn87Y1Sn_QvCaBU/edit" target="blank">rubric</a>.
        Since we worked independently for the majority of the project time, we 
        each produced our own results; I built two rockets like the other two 
        team members, but I focused more on the content and formatting of the 
        documentation than they did. After building our first rockets, we tested 
        them in the Dublin High School football field. The experimental and 
        theoretical results are shown in our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssprzrdhspIMrEuqQXSqt2uwKuGsS9JViJ24oHhEdbM/edit">documentation</a>
        and 
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHCFgiDil6Vu0QpizuNB4CclRWSWtnon4PVQfT4TwIM/edit#gid=0" target="blank">simulation</a>. 
        We concluded that Design 6, designed and built by Jasleen Kaur was the 
        best prototype because it went the furthest, 98 yards. This project 
        was helpful in learning how to use Google Sheets more effectively, and
        about aerodynamics, because it focused on the flight of the 
        projectiles, which was unlike any other project I have ever worked on 
        before.

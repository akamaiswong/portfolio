          Duration: Approximately 2 weeks (due September 7th)

          Objective: To build a project using Scratch which was user-friendly.

        For this project, I worked with a partner named Justin Tsai. We were tasked with coding either a game or story using Scratch, that implemented user interface and was relatively user-friendly with as little glitches
        as possible. We were given two introductions to Scratch, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KGkh-4VVxykHx_gpCXqSFi2AI0Yn-Jj2UoWmQv9ezlo/edit" target="blank">basic</a> one, and a more <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Oig2WzcyH4TxpAdfTKmupk-PjA6mItcHrYqY-F3ov0/edit"
          target="blank"> advanced </a> one, then were allowed to make our own project. We decided to make a game where the main character was trying to break out of detention, and the player had to pick between two different places that the person could
        go, to help the person find his way out. The character told the player how to make him choose between different places, and at some places, the character ran into different people. This meant that we not only had to program the main sprite, but
        the other secondary ones as well. The game originally included making the player use arrow keys to control the sprite, but we changed the controls to use different lettered keys instead to make the game easier to play. We also made a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KGYocGbvPS15B_IyfLDRKilmtEuuycZA69jPj1cZGmU/edit" target="blank">project notebook</a> to daily record the work that we did. Through this project, we got an understanding of the workings of Scratch,
        and I also learned how to work with a partner effectively.

          Objective: The objective was to create a brand image for a fictional 
          or real company. It needed to represent their product in a memorable 
          fashion. The purpose was to increase sales.

        For this project, I worked with a partner named Soumya Kakarlapudi. The 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g919kguNczub1LxhojTfSCugJ-o8HiE33m9lY2A0l80/edit" target="blank">instructions</a>
        were to make a logo for a fiction or creative company, as explained 
        in more detail in the objective above. The customer that we chose was 
        Amazon, and we chose to work with their recent product, the Echo Dot, 
        also known as Alexa. We compiled an amount of logos from the apps that 
        Alexa can connect to, and resized and cropped them to the same size. 
        Afterwards, we pasted them, along with the actual Alexa logo onto an 
        image of Alexa. We used a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVkstm1fGvJBQ09PgO6t8UI-MrSrjakTr7MPxb1NNNw/edit" target="blank">project log</a> 
        to document our progress in the project daily. A challenge we faced 
        was in making the loops for the manipulation less file specific. 
        We had to change our code from being file specific, to functions with 
        loops to encompass all of the images. The images that we modified can 
        be found in the project log (linked above) in original and modified 
        forms - along with credits for the original images. This project was 
        helpful in learning image manipulation in Python, and was also a great 
        lesson in team work, leadership, and delegating different tasks to 
        different people.

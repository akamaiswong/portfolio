        For this project, I worked with a partner named Justin Tsai. 
        We were tasked with coding either a game or story using Scratch,
        that implemented user interface and was relatively user-friendly with 
        as little glitches as possible. We were given two introductions to 
        Scratch, a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJtOwEhURldFN17FHMg9Xu0fixcJYUb_oqkAQPK6u_E/edit" target="blank">basic</a> one, and a more <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Oig2WzcyH4TxpAdfTKmupk-PjA6mItcHrYqY-F3ov0/edit" target="blank"> advanced </a> 
        one, then were allowed to make our own project. We decided to make a 
        game where the main character was trying to break out of detention, 
        and the player had to pick between two different places that the 
        person could go, to help the person find his way out. The character 
        told the player how to make him choose between different places, and 
        at some places, the character ran into different people. This meant 
        that we not only had to program the main sprite, but the other secondary
        ones as well. The game originally included making the player use arrow 
        keys to control the sprite, but we changed the controls to use different 
        lettered keys instead to make the game easier to play. We also made a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owITbXnfQCBjaILHuhQHm4CT7g0wR_EuvXK-EWCfS5o/edit" target="blank">project log</a>
        to daily record the work that we did. Through this project, we gained a
        better understanding of the workings of Scratch, and I also learned 
        how to work with a partner effectively.

        For this project, I worked with a partner named Soumya Kakarlapudi. The 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/199e9Tv8Ngk34M6SRc6Vk8ADr920vl0-XYr7l_XFbVbE/edit" target="blank">instructions</a>
        were to make a logo for a fiction or creative company, as explained 
        in more detail in the objective above. The customer that we chose was 
        Amazon, and we chose to work with their recent product, the Echo Dot, 
        also known as Alexa. We compiled an amount of logos from the apps that 
        Alexa can connect to, and resized and cropped them to the same size. 
        Afterwards, we pasted them, along with the actual Alexa logo onto an 
        image of Alexa. We used a 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekKP4CvQ5SjH4lznVZ2eB3gfGpilIMBYL9YA-lZKp6s/edit" target="blank">project log</a> 
        to document our progress in the project daily. A challenge we faced 
        was in making the loops for the manipulation less file specific. 
        We had to change our code from being file specific, to functions with 
        loops to encompass all of the images. The images that we modified can 
        be found in the project log (linked above) in original and modified 
        forms - along with credits for the original images. This project was 
        helpful in learning image manipulation in Python, and was also a great 
        lesson in team work, leadership, and delegating different tasks to 
        different people.

          Objective: The objective of this project was to find a configuration 
          of solar or hydrogen cells in either a series or a parallel 
          configuration to recommend to Tesla Motors. We would 
          build a prototype vehicle to test out the configuration and show it 
          to Tesla Motors as evidence of our findings.

        For this project, I worked with partners Niharika Suravarjjala and 
        Amelyn Phang. The 
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxpJ4oJGPvMTvf8QJ40VBZ83M38KrFdOivnJD6URbgk/edit" target = "blank">instructions</a>
        were to create a prototype of a vehicle that could be fueled by solar
        or hydrogen cells in different configurations, as explained in further 
        detail in the objective above. The customer was Tesla Motors, as the
        project was inspired by Tesla Motor's recent environment friendly 
        cars with renewable energy sources. We built the car with VEX parts, 
        and a breadboard for wiring the energy sources. We used configurations 
        of a single solar cell, two solar cells in parallel, a singular 
        hydrogen cell, and two hydrogen cells in series. As discussed in 
        our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAjFSbsq86-68C7-uKDeBszRYJpdwPyK2dyZ5QxaWIk/edit" target = "blank">project log,</a>
        we eventually found that the car was the most efficient with a singular 
        solar cell wired to the motor. We thought this was because the car 
        was built with a simple design meant to be as light as possible. 
        This configuration was the most efficient, with an efficiency of 53%. 
        Additionally, this design was the most practical. The single solar cell
        is easier to implement, as a singular solar cell is cheaper than any
        of the other options and is the easiest to install in a real life car.

        For this project, I worked with partners Shriya Reddy and Jasleen Kaur.
        The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sbyTgEY2PS-yhxM73Hd9YOP_NZ5TxKOUIj4rc77ZEsE/edit" target="blank">instructions</a>
        were to design and make two rocket projectiles each, to launch off of 
        a launcher, as explained in further detail in the objective above. 
        The customer was Nitro Planes, who wanted toy projectiles to sell 
        alongside their new rocket launcher. We built these model projectiles 
        out of paper products (printer paper, construction paper, etc.), and 
        tape products (duct tape, masking tape, packing tape, etc.). This project  
        was graded accoding 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHFa0UHkssiVrTGkuPOjCBKuntp3Vn87Y1Sn_QvCaBU/edit" target="blank">rubric</a>.
        After building our first rockets, we tested them in the Dublin 
        High School football field. The experimental and theoretical results 
        are shown in our 
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHCFgiDil6Vu0QpizuNB4CclRWSWtnon4PVQfT4TwIM/edit#gid=0" target="blank"></a>. 
        We concluded that Design 6, designed and built by Jasleen Kaur was the 
        best prototype because it went the furthest, 98 yards. This project 
        was helpful in learning Google Sheets, and about aerodynamics, 
        because it focused on the flight of the projectiles, unlike any other 
        project I have ever worked on before.
